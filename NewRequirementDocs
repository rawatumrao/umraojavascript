Integrate Pinning API - Summary of API calls and Pinning Scenarios needed for Layout Control Panel

Description

This ticket outlines all the necessary Pinning API Calls for the VB Layout Control Room.

Set Pinning Config

This sets the amount of available pinning spaces for the conference and must match the amount of selected participants to be included in the layout. There are 20 available pinning spaces based on our max participant count of 20. If there are too little of spaces, presenters will be missing from the layout, and if there are too many there will be blank spaces in the layout.

API Call

https://docs.pexip.com/beta/api_client/api_rest.htm#set_pinning_config

There are 20 Pinning Configurations that we have set as defined below



"pin_01","pin_02","pin_03","pin_04","pin_05","pin_06","pin_07","pin_08","pin_09","pin_10","pin_11","pin_12","pin_13","pin_14","pin_15","pin_16","pin_17","pin_18","pin_19","pin_20"
Example API Call:



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/set_pinning_config
{"pinning_config": "pin_03"}
 Clear Pinning Config

This must be done to disable the pinning mode within the Conference, you would make this call when Enabling Voice-Activation Mode. You basically just do a set_pinning_config call with a blank config "".

Example API Call



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/set_pinning_config
{"pinning_config": ""}
Get Current Pinning Config

If we need to get the current pin config that is set for the conference, this can be used.

API Call

https://docs.pexip.com/beta/api_client/api_rest.htm#get_pinning_config

Example API Call



GET /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/get_pinning_config
 
Set Participant to a Layout Group

This will assign a participant to a particular numbered space in the layout group, this will correspond with the set order of the participants.

There are 20 Pinning Layout Groups as defined below. There will be only one participant set to each layout group spot.



"one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine","ten","eleven","twelve","thirteen","fourteen","fifteen","sixteen","seventeen","eighteen","nineteen","twenty"
Example API Call



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/participants/8f246365-2955-4c23-9658-4b1b56d81bfb/layout_group
{"layout_group": "seven" }
Clearing a Participant from a Layout Group
This will remove a participant from a layout_group space and must be set if a participant is removed from the overall layout.
Example API Call



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/participants/participant1uuid/layout_group
{"layout_group": "" }

Sequence of API calls for Scenarios

Applying a Layout with Pinned Participants

Outline of Calls
1. Clear Layout Groups for any Participants previously set in Layout Group Positions that are not included in the new layout.
2. Set the Pinning Configuration that Equals the amount of selected participants.
3. Set the type of Transforms Layout 
4. Set Participants to their corresponding layout_group spaces.
5. Apply

Example of calls for setting 3 Participants in a 4:0 Layout Grid and removing one Participant.

 Remove Participant Currently in Position Three



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/participants/participant4uuid/layout_group
{"layout_group": "" }
Three Selected Participants Equals a Pinning Config of 3



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/set_pinning_config
{"pinning_config": "pin_03"}
Transform Layout to 4:0 Grid



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/transform_layout
{"transforms": {"layout": "4:0"}}
Set Participant Layout Groups for each of the participants in order, participantuuid would equal to participant’s actual UUID in API call.

First Position Participant



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/participants/participant1uuid/layout_group
{"layout_group": "one" }
Second Position Participant



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/participants/participant2uuid /layout_group
{"layout_group": "two" }
Third Position Participant



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/participants/participant2uuid /layout_group
{"layout_group": "three" }
Apply Layout and make API calls

Rules for moving in and out Pinned Participants from the Layout.

Any Participant added to the layout must have their corresponding layout_group space assigned to them.

You can’t have multiple Participants assigned to the same layout_group space.

Any Participant that has their order changed in the layout must have a newly assigned layout_group number.

Any Participant removed from the layout must have a blank ““ layout_group applied to them.


Enabling Voice Activation and DIsable Pinning Layout Control

 Clear the Pinning Configuration and set all previously pinned participants to a blank layout_group  value ””.

Set Pinning Config to Blank



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/set_pinning_config
{"pinning_config": ""}
First Position Participant to blank layout group



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/participants/participant1uuid/layout_group
{"layout_group": "" }
Second Position Participant to blank layout group



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/participants/participant2uuid/layout_group
{"layout_group": "" }
Third Position Participant to blank layout group



POST /api/client/v2/conferences/123456/participants/participant2uuid/layout_group
{"layout_group": "" }
